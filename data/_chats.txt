[12/02/25, 11:06:10 AM] Satya Chauhan 111: Hi @917411543306 , please tell to plumber to stop water for particular pipe and fix it.
[12/02/25, 11:56:49 AM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: Hi Friends 

Will discuss - Budget Interest income - Tips for Tax Harvesting :

Tax free interest income is raised to 
50 k to citizens 
100k to senior citizens

Interest : SB, RD FD

If 6 Lakhs deposited in FD then interest works out to 50 k in a financial year :
1st April to 31st March of next year ( 12 months)

No TDS/Tax on this 50 k
Totally Free 

For senior citizens up to 12 lakhs deposit @ 8% totally TDS/ Tax Free 

This 50k 100 K interest income is applicable Bank wise MAX  to be TDS free 
What happens if you get more interest than 50 k 100 k Bank wise: 
10%  TDS if PAN number is given,                         20% TDS if PAN number is not given 

TIPS for Tax harvesting :
Divide the deposit among  family members beyond 6 n  12 lakhs in one name:
Then no family Member is subject to Tax/ TDS

What if I want to increase the deposit amount beyond these limits :
Then divide the financial year n start the deposit from 1st Oct onwards :

This case you can go for a deposit of 12 lakhs for citizens n 24 lakhs for senior citizens :
Still you will be TDS/ TAX free in a financial year 

Hope I m clear:
If not reach out to me @ 8618930365

[12/02/25, 8:28:36 PM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: Hi
Worth spending time here to understand your loan repricing system in Banks.
[12/02/25, 8:32:28 PM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: Banks were reluctant to pass on the benefits of reducing interest rates in MCLR based Loans .
That's why RBI imposed RLLR, as bank's r at an obligation to reduce ROI immediately if Repo rate is reduced.
[12/02/25, 8:33:21 PM] Tamilselvan Sankaralingam Cbr: Thanks for always sharing best tips for all of us . Keep doing sir ‎<This message was edited>
[12/02/25, 8:37:03 PM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: What is Repo rate :
RBI lending rate to commercial banks.

Cost of funds is reduced with banks, which is to be passed on to loanees, this increasing Disposable income in the hands of customers which will be spent by customers in consumption for national growth, thus leading to higher GDP
[12/02/25, 8:39:12 PM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: Unless the deposit rates are decreased , the cost of funds for individual banks remain high.
This is the irony
[12/02/25, 8:39:43 PM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: Thanks for your time 🙏

[13/02/25, 4:29:25 PM] ~ Gajendra: On party hall...wanted to understand the charges..which is electricity and cleaning charges..

Till now is there any differentiation on electricity consumption on ev charging point ..is there any process ..who is charging how much..I believe ..couple of residents are using it but the bill is shared by all the residents...

I have seen people used to charge ev vehicles near to the entrance..

In the same time the cleaning staff will be under our control ..

It's not a matter of 500 or 1000 rupees..

It's like u have planted a guava tree but u r not able to eat
[13/02/25, 4:30:17 PM] ~ Gajendra: It can be a agenda in the GBM meeting before poll
[13/02/25, 4:46:53 PM] Chandrakant CBR 210: Yes per my Observation I have seen one of  Resident used to Log the Unit Consumption ..for electric Scooters ..
The Log book is with security .. we need to really appreciates the Resident  . In absence of the Association also the a they  logging the when they are putting Charges.. 

Association should have consideration on this ..


 Make some Guidelines for Charging also ‎<This message was edited>
[13/02/25, 4:58:47 PM] ~ Gajendra: I have no idea ..if somebody is logging or not in the registar ..that's not reflected anywhere in the bills..I m not demanding clarification ..

That means u r giving one community service for free but for other u r  charging ...

Thing is- it should be uniform everywhere ..

Charge them also who are charging vehicles and car..

No offence to the ev owners ..
[13/02/25, 5:01:24 PM] Chandrakant CBR 210: Yes .. yes it’s not there in any bills .. but as Responsibly the resident is logging it’s good ..


Because some time association was not in charge  . no one collected any amount .. from them ,but Now association have to take Consideration on this ev charging also ‎<This message was edited>
[13/02/25, 5:01:59 PM] Swagat Shukla CBR: Hi sir we will be looking into it previously also we asked not to charge until we don't have separate meters for the EVs

Please check whether nomination is recorded in all your 
SB
RD
Fd
Locker 
Demat 
Mutual Funds etc.

Also convert your single account into a joint account : 
Operated by                Either or Survivor 
( In case of two joint holders only)
Else convert it to be operated by : :
All of us or Survivors 
{ In case of more than two joint account holders)

It becomes easier to continue the operations in the account, if one of the joint account hloder dies.

New or old. 

Let me what is delivery policy after 11pm(whatever window for benefit of society ) with security team. 
If owner/tenet is not  lifted delivery guy call.
Its should taken by the security team or reject by security.
Because I don't get notification from NBH(secondary person from home who has NBH can also check) 
There should be more option if delivery guy withstand at gate for delivery or SUCH) 

Security should reach resident using NBH, else I am confused with role of security here to handle the  delivery 

As per security, one resident scolded him for taking delivery without permission so going froward they stopped to kept at room. 

Food thrown infront of gate, this kind of act get raged... No worries, not scolded security.


Also please educate or share common delivery policy across residents.

Some scenarios  can be  baby care or medication deliveries also.

We’ve noticed that the ground floor kitchen sinks are experiencing reverse water flow. The main cause seems to be disposing of large amounts of water into the sinks, especially in the 12 series flats.

Could we all please avoid putting excessive water into the kitchen sinks? This will help prevent any further issues and keep things running smoothly for everyone. 😊

[04/03/25, 9:33:23 PM] Ranjith CBR G11: Obviously, as ground floor residents, we're doomed to deal with this. No one else seems to care or understand the issues we face. I'll try to be more mindful, but it's annoying that we're always the ones who have to adapt. Actually not just reverse flow, may be the drain is clogged. Please check as we have recently done a hack to get it resolved, sadly on our own expense. You can ask Chinna to do the same.

Atleast one of our family members is always at home and we need things to be delivered at home. The security doesn't call for confirmation whether the package can be left at the gate and just accepts it without our consent. Kindly suggest how to resolve this issue.

We had an issue with a borewell near the security room. The security personnel are operating it based on water flow, but after switching it off for an hour, they found that someone had turned the motor back on. This is a serious concern, as a dry run can damage the motor.

Additionally, the motor pump has already been repaired twice this week, and while the cause of the issue has been identified as someone is switching on the motor we still don’t know who is switching it on apart from the security, especially during the night

[14/03/25, 8:12:42 PM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: Dear all,

I wish to inform you all that the Govt. of India has set up a Senior citizen help line phone no. 14567 (just dial the number *directly* without any area code or any prefix).  I checked on this phone and I was pleasantly surprised by the response by a lady.  This centre provides any help / support needed by Senior citizens between 8 am and 8 pm.  One can refer to a case of Senior citizens in distress, medical help needed, or protection from harassment, vaccination centres nearby etc.  I was very impressed by the person who expressed concern with the  promise for immediate help.  I would suggest we must share and circulate this information widely to help those in need of help.

Please note that the service is available between 8 am to 8 pm only and this service is available in every State except in Haryana and West Bengal, where it has not started as yet but will shortly.  Will you please circulate this message to all the Senior citizens in your circle (friends, relatives, neighbours).  This is a great initiative taken by the Government of India and will definitely extend benefits to those Senior citizens who are in need of assistance.
 
Very informative, it’s working.  Please share the same in all of your groups.🙏🙏🙏

Thank you!

Best regards,

[16/03/25, 11:24:10 AM] Krishna Mehta 112: Has someone turned on the tap?
[16/03/25, 11:29:03 AM] ~ Shyam Sinha: We can explore options for water harvesting  or check the present system if it is there.
[16/03/25, 11:29:19 AM] Krishna Mehta 112: Please understand let us finish the work and if someone is working on the main line. I expect people to understand not to turn on like this without informing.
[16/03/25, 11:31:49 AM] Moontashi Rajiv 610: Can this be tried?
[16/03/25, 11:35:54 AM] Deepak Patel 303: Yes, I think rain water harvesting through the roof may help reduce our ground water requirements and also help recharging ground water. 
Also we may consult and see possibilities of other nearby water sources.
Also if not done today, recycled treated waste water can be used for gardening purposes.
[16/03/25, 11:42:22 AM] ~ Shyam Sinha: It's a good option.
[16/03/25, 11:44:25 AM] Deepak Patel 303: Also if we are aware where we as a society may be wasting more water, we can think of ways to reduce that.
The water in the storage tanks can have sensors to prevent over filling and spilling, if it's happening today.
[16/03/25, 11:48:08 AM] Vikas CBR 302: Our solar water system can be  significant contributor to water wastage in our community. Every time someone wants to take a hot shower, they need to let the water run for at least 5-6 liters before the hot water starts flowing. This means that for every shower, we're wasting around 5-6 liters of water.

Considering we have 100 flats in our community, and assuming 80% of them use the solar water system daily, that's a staggering 400 liters of water wasted every day. Over the course of a month, that adds up to 12,000 liters of wasted water.My suggestion is to temporarily suspend the use of the solar water system to observe and assess our water usage patterns.
[16/03/25, 12:05:47 PM] ~ Gajendra: Anybody has the pricelist bracket for the services provided by fm??
[16/03/25, 12:11:14 PM] ~ Himansu: We need to install a water meter and charge based on uses ... 
Definitely rain water harvesting is an option to raise the water level

[19/03/25, 10:59:38 AM] Moontashi Rajiv 610: The building doesn't have security personnel?

Although there is not much to be expected from security, the cctv cameras definitely help.

But why rob a medical shop? It can't have too many valuables... Unless its a petty theft - as we can see only one person in the vid.

Few months back there was an incident where a Nepali was robbed n injured by another Nepali... Our cctv caught something.

A growing concern -  we have overdependence on the Nepali populace - maids, security, helpers of all kinds, they are abundant and come cheaper than the locals - but they can easily abscond, we have no clue where they belong to - most have  aadhar cards - which us very easy to get - n yet if need be they can vanish into nowhere.

[21/03/25, 1:43:13 PM] Eswara Varaprasad N 605: Dear Association,

I have noticed that some visitors are parking their two-wheelers in my designated parking area. Despite my previous instructions to the security team to ensure that visitor vehicles are not parked in residents’ spaces, this issue continues to persist.

Recently, and again today, visitors have parked their two-wheelers in my space, even moving my cycles aside. A similar incident occurred earlier, which resulted in damage to both my cycles, costing me approximately 800/- in repairs.

I kindly request the Association to take this matter seriously and implement a proper alternative parking arrangement for visitors, both for two-wheelers and cars, to prevent further inconvenience to residents.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
[21/03/25, 1:58:26 PM] Sudheer Yadhav CBR: Hello!! 

This is my cousin’s bike, and I was unaware of where he had parked it. The security team also did not take an entry record, and he entered the society without prior approval. Additionally, the security team did not inform the other guards about his entry.

Since my cousin was unaware of the designated guest parking area, he parked near the lift. Later, when he went to retrieve the bike, he found that it had been moved to the parking spot of Flat 605. I have already explained the situation to the security team and also informed the facility manager.

I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused. It was both my mistake and a lapse on the part of the security team. 

*Additionally, my cousin did not move the bike to Flat 605’s parking area—someone else must have shifted it there.*.

[21/03/25, 2:26:58 PM] Moontashi Rajiv 610: Big basket/amazon comes without prior information at times

Also one evening an elderly gentleman asked the security about some milk packet - security answered back 'pata nahi' very harshly - this is not an acceptable behaviour.

Earlier security personnel were so pleasant - they used to greet smile and were reliable in terms of instructions.

Request the association members to kindly look into this. 😊🙏

If you encounter any facility related issues,

First, raise the issue in NBH app,

Second, if the issue remains unresolved, escalate it to the association.

Third, If it is still not resolved, you may post it here.

So before posting here, ensure that you have at least one ticket.

[22/03/25, 9:02:51 AM] Moontashi Rajiv 610: Morning Rajilesh - yes I and my husband have changed all the settings as suggested by our friends in cbr community and also anywhere we could find.

The lapse is from the security - they don't insist on entry always, the delivery personnel try to take advantage of it and evade the process.

[22/03/25, 9:10:25 AM] Moontashi Rajiv 610: All off 🤣
[22/03/25, 9:12:34 AM] Moontashi Rajiv 610: Also it is not for all deliveries - it happens occasionally but consistently - so it is not a technical snag but a human error.
[22/03/25, 9:13:53 AM] rajilesh panoli: Ok we will check with them. Thank you
[22/03/25, 9:18:05 AM] Moontashi Rajiv 610: Thanks bro - and as mentioned earlier overall we don't feel the connect - it would be nice if we had more engaging interactive and overall responsive personnel as security. Thanks and have a good day🖖

[22/03/25, 9:25:37 AM] rajilesh panoli: Okay, kindly give the details of delivery and time, we will check with the team.
[22/03/25, 9:26:04 AM] rajilesh panoli: Delivery person contact number and date time.
[22/03/25, 9:26:26 AM] rajilesh panoli: ‎You deleted this message.
[22/03/25, 9:27:04 AM] rajilesh panoli: We are checking with nbh team as well
[22/03/25, 10:47:14 AM] Moontashi Rajiv 610: I am sorry to say guys but I feel that you are trying to deliberately overlook the real issue here - that is the incompetent security personnel who are not even well behaved. ‎<This message was edited>
[22/03/25, 10:48:17 AM] Moontashi Rajiv 610: The nbh app or team is not the issue
[22/03/25, 10:51:10 AM] Moontashi Rajiv 610: Am sorry to have taken up your time and this space to take up this issue which I felt was important.

If possible kindly look into the options of either educating the security personnel on both technical and behavioral issues or replacing them

Once again there is no issue with the nbh app as of now.

Thanks for your time guys 😊🖖
[22/03/25, 11:36:35 AM] rajilesh panoli: It’s a serious issue which is why. Will check with them anyway. Thanks
[22/03/25, 11:49:00 AM] Satya Chauhan 111: Somebody is using drilling machine on generator, please stop it.
[22/03/25, 11:49:37 AM] Krishna 707: We already requested to change the security. 0 tolerance. Just looking for reasons to avoid such incidents
[22/03/25, 11:49:52 AM] Krishna 707: We spoke to security and given instructions
[22/03/25, 11:51:48 AM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: Excellent.
ThanQ🙏
[22/03/25, 11:56:32 AM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: House keeping people leaving 3 to 4 buckets in the Lifts with dirty water filled in.
I don't really understand why this is done now only n not by the previous house keeping.
Spoiling the hygiene and health of the owner residents with lots of Kids 
Someone can help me to understand the purpose
[22/03/25, 12:15:16 PM] Prasanna Kumar CBR: In previous house keeping also I have seen multiple times carrying dirty water in lifts.
But no one has pointed that time I don't know.
[22/03/25, 12:17:18 PM] Swagat Shukla CBR: Will inform to HK team not to do the same practice
[22/03/25, 12:17:23 PM] Swagat Shukla CBR: It's not good
[22/03/25, 12:18:06 PM] Swagat Shukla CBR: Will inform
[22/03/25, 12:20:01 PM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: When I observed this  I hv  pointed out this without linking this to any  association.
When you HV noticed what prevented you from pointing it out.?
Whether old or new association , here our health is more important than who is there in the association.
Please don't link like this
[22/03/25, 12:22:44 PM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: When we call ourselves professionals, let us maintain professionalism.
Whether you are there or I m there in the association, owners are important/ permanent.
This is my perception please
[22/03/25, 12:32:39 PM] Prasanna Kumar CBR: I never brought association here you only bring it here. I'm talking about housekeeping service only. What in your mind comes out. 
And I don't need to learn professionally from anyone. Everyone is aware of how things are handled by some people before. 
And I'm not part of the current association  I'm just like you as a resident. 
This is my perception please
[22/03/25, 12:35:40 PM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: You only raised the issue why people hv not pointed out earlier.
What does it mean ?
What is there in your mind I could guess
[22/03/25, 12:39:34 PM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: I mean every resident/ owner is responsible here, though association is only a mouth piece of us.
I don't link anything to the association.
I m doing my duty of bringing it to the knowledge of residents/ owners
[22/03/25, 12:40:27 PM] Prasanna Kumar CBR: All house keeping has using lift for dirty waters in the bucket not only now from early also. 
But why you bring this concern now 
What it means I can guess as well.
[22/03/25, 12:42:06 PM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: I never said this :
They are leaving the buckets in the Lifts.
House keeping people are not there in the Lifts.
Buckets r going up n down
[22/03/25, 12:45:31 PM] Prasanna Kumar CBR: I'm not even pointed to any association here. 
This is not the first time house keeping they are doing this task they are doing from early as well. I just want to keep everyone aware of this.
[22/03/25, 12:46:45 PM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: Thanks for your observation.
I leave it to your wisdom/ professionalism to understand the issues in a proper way
[22/03/25, 12:46:52 PM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: Good Luck
[22/03/25, 12:47:19 PM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: Hi Residents 
Sorry for wasting your precious time
[22/03/25, 11:52:10 AM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: We can't afford to risk our security with this security
[22/03/25, 11:52:37 AM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: At the earliest changing is the best for our health
[22/03/25, 11:53:30 AM] Krishna 707: The issue already escalated to the vendor. Asap they will change
[22/03/25, 11:53:40 AM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: Great
[22/03/25, 1:03:09 PM] Rohit Kumar CBR 412: Why are you sorry Uncle you have not said anything wrong. Don't be sorry. We as a family can suggest for good thing to make this place beautiful.. I think association is doing great job so you can give your inputs and observation anytime anywhere.
[22/03/25, 1:04:57 PM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: Thanks for understanding my perspective in a right manner.
[22/03/25, 1:08:17 PM] Rohit Kumar CBR 412: That point was genuine and kids are also using the lifts they can put their hands on dirty water or can spill inside the lifts.. Better to take buckets with them self.
[22/03/25, 1:10:48 PM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: Every coin has two sides.
If you can see on one side, I can see the other side.
Perception differs

Have a good day
[24/03/25, 8:31:31 AM] Gaurav Lakhera Cbr: Hi Krish,

Did you guys get a chance to discuss Property tax with the builder, which he has collected from us but didn't pay till date.
[24/03/25, 10:06:22 AM] ~ Raghu: No water on both bathroom of 6 series
[24/03/25, 10:07:00 AM] ~ BKG: @917411543306 - no water in kitchen for 9 series in RO line, is the issue not resolved yet?

[24/03/25, 1:25:26 PM] ~ Gajendra: Can not we ask builder to come once to apartment and clear out this property tax thing..

I know it's not association work
[24/03/25, 1:27:35 PM] ~ Gajendra: We have very less time ..after April 1 they will levy 100% fine
[24/03/25, 1:28:55 PM] Satya Chauhan 111: Gather all flat members and ask him.
[24/03/25, 1:29:46 PM] ~ Gajendra: That's what I am saying..may be GBM we can ask all other concern as well if we have any
[24/03/25, 1:31:02 PM] Satya Chauhan 111: Today is 24 March.  And you  also know how many members joining GBM meeting ‎<This message was edited>

[24/03/25, 1:34:10 PM] ~ Gajendra: 6 months is very good time

If builder did not paid then each owner will be impacted
[24/03/25, 1:34:20 PM] ~ Gajendra: And have to pay from our pocket ‎<This message was edited>

[24/03/25, 1:44:41 PM] ~ Gajendra: Can association team do some jugad ..

[24/03/25, 1:57:42 PM] ~ Gajendra: Who took 50k money..is it rajgopal
[24/03/25, 2:02:39 PM] Gaurav Lakhera Cbr: Was thinking since it is a common problem for everyone so it would be great if someone from the association can take care on the behalf of everyone. Anyway, I have pinged Ashok for the same... Thank you
[24/03/25, 2:06:01 PM] Prasanna Kumar CBR: If he already paid ask for payment receipt of payment
[24/03/25, 2:10:26 PM] Krishna.CBR 113: In this case, if individual is not interested to reach to that cheater(Builder) and association cannot take this matter..shall i go and proceed with payment as I don’t have time for this headache…Just posting this as i shouldn’t be judged with in CBR as a rebel.Just looking for peace of mind and avoid paying more accrued interest.Thank you. ‎<This message was edited>
[24/03/25, 2:11:52 PM] ~ Gajendra: Builder told ... did not got the receipt and share the dd reciept with the payment related person who was handling

And some one told in our group penalty will be erased after Mar 31 is it false information.
I just saw some posts saying adding 100% penalty after April 1.
Otherwise we need to get our amount back from the builder with a penalty we will pay ourselves.
[24/03/25, 2:18:57 PM] Prasanna Kumar CBR: Mine is 28k bro
[24/03/25, 2:19:25 PM] Krishna.CBR 113: Luckier than me 😜

Better if we can scrap them from tomorrow 1st April onwards :
Let us not keep our safety at risk.

[02/04/25, 8:51:23 AM] Krishna 707: For everyone info -- obulreddyy and Ashish came along with me voluntarily to support was there with me till 11pm. We spent around 3 hours for everything. Thanks @918860304248 207 and @obul Reddy and 307
[02/04/25, 8:57:05 AM] Aritra Ranjan Das 109: This issue never happened when earlier vendor was maintaining the STP, which means that person was aware of this and used to maintain the water level properly..

Why this knowledge was not transferred to the new vendor? We are changing vendor without proper handover.. 

Sorry to say, but the issues we are experiencing with multiple things with new vendor like Security, STP etc. raises questions on their credibility and we should think on this. 

For saving money we are risking our security and amenities.. which is not correct as per my understanding.
[02/04/25, 9:00:01 AM] Krishna 707: The person should give proper KT to the working person and the ground reality is different. If you feel the risk involved you can take up the responsibility. Still we will welcome you . 

Why this knowledge was not transferred you speak to the stp guy and experience once ‎<This message was edited>
[02/04/25, 9:01:26 AM] Krishna 707: We already confirmed a change in security will happen. And the previous vendor we have given one month notice and they want release in a week. They supported man power in a week.
[02/04/25, 9:07:21 AM] Aritra Ranjan Das 109: I am questioning the vendor change here itself, why did even we changed the vendor when everything was running smoothly?

It was association decision to change vendor. Now why you are asking us to come forward and reduce the risk. You cancel the vendor change and go back to previous one.
[02/04/25, 9:07:51 AM] Krishna 707: Smoothly 😂😂
[02/04/25, 9:07:54 AM] Krishna 707: Well said
[02/04/25, 9:08:02 AM] Krishna 707: Now u r asking questions

[02/04/25, 9:12:51 AM] Aritra Ranjan Das 109: First of all STP was not maintained by Caprico, it was separate. And yes all supported vendor change provided your assurance over GBM that association will ensure all handover will be done properly.. which was never happened.
[02/04/25, 9:13:56 AM] Aritra Ranjan Das 109: At least basement was not flooded and there was no risk to get electric shock.
[02/04/25, 9:14:51 AM] Krishna 707: -2 basement will fill completely with stp water 
 That much water we have 😂😂😂
[02/04/25, 9:15:46 AM] Krishna 707: The extra 2 feet of water you are speaking of.  That too on the first day and you are not aware of what's happening also speaking.
[02/04/25, 9:17:52 AM] Krishna 707: Anyways I don't want to argue or debate. You want to know more, you can as much as possible. It was the builder who has to give proper handover . Assurance is different .. appreciate if you can ask builder with sameway.You take up the responsibility and give assurance and see. Then my turn ‎<This message was edited>
[02/04/25, 9:19:56 AM] Krishna 707: Still we are giving you choice. Take the poll on new association. Yes or no. If all says no. Take it

[02/04/25, 9:24:41 AM] Krishna 707: Duct cleaning, free wifi connection, all leakage fixing, grass cutting, cost cutting, park cleaning, NOBROKERHOOD -- ALL THE ABOVE never happened and you never questioned and you are coming and asking for water leakage 😂😂😂
[02/04/25, 9:25:02 AM] Krishna 707: This was not done before and was not risking amenities
[02/04/25, 9:25:35 AM] Krishna 707: Only two security is a risk for the entire society that too after we assured we change them 😂😂😂😂😂😂
[02/04/25, 9:26:00 AM] Krishna 707: Have you ever gone to terrace and seen the situation how it was.
[02/04/25, 9:26:20 AM] CS Reshma Cbr: And i really don't think maintaining the water level is a temporaey solution and in the name of the vendor change we are deviating from the actual issue which is the basic issue here.
[02/04/25, 9:27:11 AM] Krishna 707: Instead of questioning why the hole was open , it did not happen before is a strange.
[02/04/25, 9:27:28 AM] Krishna 707: Find the solution not the question
[02/04/25, 9:27:29 AM] CS Reshma Cbr: Exactly my point 😂 so strange
[02/04/25, 9:28:18 AM] Krishna 707: @917278968578 -- what is risking like amenities etc please eloborate -- we will look into ot
[02/04/25, 9:28:21 AM] Swagat Shukla CBR: Hi everyone please be patient things will be streamlined when new vendor comes it takes little time . To understand and the KT given also was not 100% correct from nagaraju so i request don't get panic
[02/04/25, 9:28:57 AM] Krishna 707: Right Swagat. Simply coming here and speaking we cannot accept
[02/04/25, 9:29:12 AM] Krishna 707: Really if there is a concern we can look into it
[02/04/25, 9:29:45 AM] Krishna 707: Terrace leakage is there, cracks are there, sump flooring is not done properly. People who is speaking to go and check everything and speak
[02/04/25, 9:29:58 AM] Krishna 707: We are not working for the society and we are not employees anymore
[02/04/25, 9:31:06 AM] Krishna 707: I can also compare 100 things with the previous vendor
[02/04/25, 9:31:57 AM] CS Reshma Cbr: Rightly said. Everything needs time
[02/04/25, 9:32:30 AM] Krishna 707: There was an harrasment happen no one knows, security fixed stp pipeline nonine knows
[02/04/25, 9:32:50 AM] Swagat Shukla CBR: Krishna leave it he is not aware of ground realities.

[02/04/25, 9:33:16 AM] Krishna 707: Then he should not question first m informing everything also a problem
[02/04/25, 9:33:21 AM] Krishna 707: It's not a fun game

[02/04/25, 9:36:05 AM] Krishna 707: When mygate to nbh vendor change np one questioned because of benefits and features right
[02/04/25, 9:36:29 AM] Krishna 707: Now park and Play area cleaning also happening we don't question because we are happy right
[02/04/25, 9:36:40 AM] Krishna 707: Duct cleaning happened why no one questioned
[02/04/25, 9:37:06 AM] Krishna 707: Why not previous vendor when they stayed more than year
[02/04/25, 9:37:32 AM] Krishna 707: Terrace leakage ls was not fixed before it's not a threat 😂😂😂😂 and not risking society
[02/04/25, 9:37:45 AM] rajilesh panoli: You were the one of those who opposed the 3.5 sft, rate earlier and now you are asking the opposite. We are ready to charge 3.5sqft. But funny thing is some people even don’t pay the current maintenance.
[02/04/25, 9:38:04 AM] Krishna 707: This is not a risk
[02/04/25, 9:38:39 AM] Krishna 707: We are asking for 3 people to join and olno one responded but we want everything effectively

[02/04/25, 9:44:58 AM] Krishna 707: Guys get ready for next set of questions. On the machines Caprico gave with good condition now all gone. You spoiled society. If Caprico maintains machinery will be permanent and no repair

[02/04/25, 10:33:20 AM] Aritra Ranjan Das 109: @917411543306 : Thanks for all your messages (bashing).. Hope you were able to vent out your frustration via these 😂

As time passes, you yourself will find the risks of having cheap technicians vs qualified technicians.. I have never said Caprico was perfect though..

Regarding association, I haven’t questioned or asked you to step down or taking poll against you guys.. you yourself seems doubtful about your work and asking for poll to prove your support 😂😂

Anyways.. carry on with your way of working.. 
I have taken a note that instead of paying maintenance amount we are not allowed to raise questions on issues as we are not involved in any ground work.
[02/04/25, 10:40:23 AM] Krishna 707: Can you read it again without frustration
[02/04/25, 10:40:32 AM] Krishna 707: This too

[02/04/25, 10:43:42 AM] rajilesh panoli: We will think about the 3.5sft.   Hope you are ready to pay around 6k.
[02/04/25, 10:43:42 AM] Krishna 707: It depends on you again how you want to take it.
[02/04/25, 10:45:41 AM] Krishna 707: Coming back to my work  . Yes I am doubtful on my work. Very much doubtful and not capable of changing vendor, not capable of getting benches to park not capable of speaking to the builder and not capable of conducting GBMS. our team is very weak bro. Please form a new stronnggggg team. Let us also learn from them
[02/04/25, 10:46:24 AM] Krishna 707: Still would love to know what kind of risks are involved for amenities
[02/04/25, 10:52:48 AM] Swagat Shukla CBR: 😂😂😂
[02/04/25, 10:55:04 AM] Krishna 707: Slight correction please. Me and my team are not working for CBR. We are helping each other to make CBR run smoothly .
[02/04/25, 11:27:32 AM] Sonali 505: When we are managing things not only by saying but practically in ground in all possible ways to run society smoothly.
There are 90% good happening which is visible to everybody, for 10% you guys can come for solution as raising question seems to be more knowledgeable person but not pointing out in such harsh ways.
We are hiring qualified technicians not cheap technicians where many hardware parts were already damaged before or new parts replaced and repair is happening one by one.
Whoever are advising please come forward as volunteer and work as a team, welcome always. 👍🏻 ‎<This message was edited>

[02/04/25, 1:19:31 PM] Krishna 707: Reason for water leakage. The problem is with the holes made and not because of the technician. It has to be closed --  for everyone information
[02/04/25, 1:19:47 PM] Krishna 707: Water quality checking
[02/04/25, 1:19:56 PM] Krishna 707: Problem root cause
[02/04/25, 1:20:22 PM] Krishna 707: Blind statements on technicians cannot be accepted without knowing the truth
[02/04/25, 1:24:55 PM] Krishna 707: Extra information. All the sumps were not completely filled these many days. Just managed. Extra water sent outside which means.
[02/04/25, 1:25:31 PM] Krishna 707: When filling was done completely, we came to know the issues
[02/04/25, 1:25:59 PM] Krishna 707: This is understanding the reality.
[02/04/25, 1:27:34 PM] Krishna 707: Marking was done and needed to close the hole asap as it might cause the issue and will be a problem in future too
[02/04/25, 1:29:46 PM] Krishna 707: Again I request all residents to cross check before we say something about what actually happens. Blind statements we are not ready to listen to . How you want to take this is your choice. My team intention is very clear for the smooth running of CBR society . Society should be clean and neat. If not find a way to make it clean
[02/04/25, 1:32:50 PM] Krishna 707: Last message for the day, till now we have not shared yet
[02/04/25, 1:36:24 PM] Krishna 707: Many of the residents share feedback directly to our team and not in the group. Planting neem tree, swimming pool, planting mango tree, lawyer suggestions, helping when required physical presence and a lot. Thanks to everyone who is taking positive and supporting to make our CBR smooth and healthy. Once again thanks. Just very few i shared. Many working on solar to reduce cost, some working on water saving, some working our society lighting to save etc etc . When plan in action all the details will be shared and will be implemented with everyone approval.
[02/04/25, 1:36:43 PM] Krishna 707: Once again thanks alot have a good and do a fruitful work ❤️❤️

[02/04/25, 2:22:29 PM] Krishna 707: Filters gone, no lubrication done, no oil change

[02/04/25, 2:25:14 PM] Krishna 707: As time passes, you will never know the truth and one fine day may blast also
[02/04/25, 2:26:01 PM] Krishna 707: Very badddddddd smell. If it was on properly, i dare you to stand near stp for 10 seconds
[02/04/25, 2:32:28 PM] Krishna 707: A cheap technician found the issue 😂😂😂😂😂
[02/04/25, 2:34:58 PM] Ranjan Cbr 606: For what work we were paying him so far ??
[02/04/25, 2:35:29 PM] Tamilselvan Sankaralingam Cbr: Thanks @917411543306  for transparency and for taking action swiftly and lets ensure good maintenance plan even if it costs a bit .

[02/04/25, 2:35:51 PM] Krishna 707: He is leaving today
[02/04/25, 2:37:02 PM] rajilesh panoli: Some people believe that only expensive things are of good quality.
[02/04/25, 2:37:05 PM] Krishna 707: As a team some comments we don't accept. Vendor change, operator change, speaking on technicians like cheap etc etc. ground work is different. I hope everyone understands now how the people manage us if we don't involve
[02/04/25, 2:37:54 PM] Krishna 707: We will definitely spend where ever required and not for the name sake
[02/04/25, 2:38:08 PM] rajilesh panoli: Yup
[02/04/25, 2:40:36 PM] CS Reshma Cbr: Transparency has become a liability. Despite the risks to life and society, people are willing to overlook facts and compromise on safety. Whether it's ignoring a sump hole, consuming untreated water, or bypassing filters, the real concern is not the issue itself, but rather the inconvenience of changing vendors.
[02/04/25, 2:43:49 PM] rajilesh panoli: And we are not sure whether we drank before was filtered or not, or what kind of diseases it might cause for everyone

[02/04/25, 2:49:14 PM] Krishna 707: Within no time without knowing the facts, passing comments will hurt and passing comments on technicians though they are trying to give their best
[02/04/25, 2:49:49 PM] Krishna 707: If things are not going as expected, we can tell them to do as expected. Not passing comments as unqualified
[02/04/25, 2:50:19 PM] Krishna 707: Still if they are not capable enough to do, then pass the comments is agreed
[02/04/25, 2:51:22 PM] Krishna 707: Not filtered. The truth is more mixing chloride water which will directly work on ur body as an agent to kill you
[02/04/25, 2:56:49 PM] rajilesh panoli: Even I and my family faced some difficulties during that time. No idea how long we will stay healthy. Only God knows.
[02/04/25, 3:02:22 PM] Krishna 707: Now there is no chance of water mixing . The previous team was taken care. Thanks team
[02/04/25, 3:32:05 PM] Ashish Singh CBR: Are we saying he was mixing chloride in our drinking water?
[02/04/25, 3:36:15 PM] Ashish Singh CBR: Yesterday Nagaraju was saying everything is working and new technician doesn’t know. This man was living his life here only by making fool all the residents. Because we never asked him what are u doing 
We blindly believe whatever he is doing, doing correct only.

We have to come out from this mind set , we are living here and this is our property. We paid for it so we should at least pay some attention
[02/04/25, 3:36:32 PM] Swagat Shukla CBR: Let's call Krishna the STP vendor

[02/04/25, 3:44:06 PM] Ashish Singh CBR: Yes, until unless someone mixed it from terrace

[02/04/25, 4:33:37 PM] Krishna 707: Already it was separated. But we are using it for the garden, there was an effect of chlorine water to Garden

[03/04/25, 8:41:22 PM] ~ Abhishek: Why is the maintenance cost increasing day by day, even after changing the vendor? We switched vendors expecting a reduction in costs, but they remain the same. Also, when are we starting maintenance collection based on sqft? Right now, 2BHK owners are unfairly paying a higher amount every month.

[04/04/25, 12:16:57 PM] Chandrakant CBR 210: Exactly we needed
[04/04/25, 12:29:41 PM] Rohit Kumar CBR 412: If all will agree we can start the process. Let's make this happen this year before Ganesha festival. I know association members are already giving lot of efforts to run the society daily works. And are really doing thankless job on this ups and down time.  So requesting other people to come forward and give nominations for the Ganesha temple process.
[04/04/25, 1:04:00 PM] Satya Chauhan 111: First who will take the responsibility. And come forward to start.
[04/04/25, 1:05:10 PM] Satya Chauhan 111: Please nominate yourself to start such a wonderful step
[04/04/25, 1:15:59 PM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: I think Lord Ganesha will take care , like it was proved in The previous Ganesha Festival

[04/04/25, 3:37:15 PM] ~ Abhishek: Hi all,
I don’t intend to hurt anyone’s religious sentiments but I am not in support of having a temple or any religious place inside the society common area.
[04/04/25, 3:40:28 PM] Kishore Cbr 208: My opinion also the same.
[04/04/25, 3:47:18 PM] ~ Albin Jose: I completely agree. To maintain harmony and respect for all residents, it's best to avoid establishing any religious spaces within the society.
[04/04/25, 3:53:10 PM] Chandrakant CBR 210: My thinking  my learning  is Ganesh was  before the Some one To find word Religion ..

In my perspectives Ganesh is not belongs to any religion ..

Note: 
I am not Belongs to any Religion..   in my book there is no word of Religion /Caste 

 But only on paper of Govt official I am  belongs to one Religion ../Caste 

I would like to Request  every one please don’t take it  argumentatively.. just Sharing My view ‎<This message was edited>
[04/04/25, 4:05:20 PM] Sudheer Yadhav CBR: Im in
[04/04/25, 4:10:45 PM] ~ Danis Cherry: Hi all, I believe we all have our own worship spaces in our individual flats for our personal spiritual needs. The idea of building a Ganesh temple in the society might seem appealing, it could lead to complications in the long run. It might affect our relationships with one another due to differing religious opinions. In order to avoid potential conflicts, it might be best to not have such common arrangements. 

We never know the other groups may ask for church/mosque or any other arrangement. So it is best to not have such arrangements in the society building.
[04/04/25, 4:18:44 PM] Sudheer Yadhav CBR: I understand and respect everyone’s perspective on this matter. However, I’d like to clarify that the proposal for a Ganesh temple within our society is not solely a religious matter but a cultural tradition that has been followed for generations. *Ganesh Utsav, for example, is widely celebrated as a community event that brings people together, fostering unity and harmony.* 

While concerns about potential complications are valid, many societies successfully have common temples or places of worship without conflicts. If specific challenges are anticipated, we should discuss them openly rather than assuming issues will arise. Instead of dismissing the idea outright, we can explore solutions that address concerns while respecting cultural traditions.

To ensure a fair decision, *if needed, we can consider conducting a poll among residents to determine the collective opinion.* After all, our society belongs to all of us, and decisions should reflect the majority’s sentiment while respecting everyone’s comfort.

Let’s discuss this constructively and find a solution that works for everyone. 🙏
[04/04/25, 4:19:08 PM] ~ Abhishek: Good one, i am in Rohit
[04/04/25, 4:20:53 PM] ~ Danis Cherry: I hope I made sense by expressing my opinion here and I hope you consider my opinion to have long lasting relationship and peace among the residents. 

I'm just foreseeing the futuristic events and can avoid all these unwanted consequences if we stand together on this.
[04/04/25, 4:26:10 PM] Ravi Raju 308 CBR: Our country itself has majority Hidus only. If we conduct poll also, we get majority. How it will be justifiable conducting a poll for these kind of decisions.
[04/04/25, 4:26:59 PM] Chandrakant CBR 210: no worries we are not Conducting polls
[04/04/25, 4:33:22 PM] ~ Abhishek: Since we are talking about a permanent structure within the society premises I would recommend to have a consent from each and every flat owner.

But honestly I don’t want to enforce anything. But I will also hope the same from the other side as well.
[04/04/25, 4:40:59 PM] Chandrakant CBR 210: Some Positive energies Required to Our Society  from Who is not a belong to any Religion .. 
So 
Ganesh is Best Person .. to sit   
On the  Bench and He can  See the our what’s app  Fights and  All..and stop 


Just My view ..
[04/04/25, 4:41:44 PM] Chandrakant CBR 210: Let’s see no worries we all respect all People ‘s faiths ‎<This message was edited>

Ofcourse both theory and practice makes us more perfect - I believe

[05/04/25, 4:20:54 PM] Moontashi Rajiv 610: Hi guys - amazon is refusing to deliver because they are not allowed to keep their bikes inside. They say that there are high value items and it is not safe to keep it lying outside the premises as it takes time to deliver to the door step.
[05/04/25, 4:21:31 PM] Moontashi Rajiv 610: Is it possible that we let the delivery guys park their bikes inside as earlier?
[05/04/25, 4:22:39 PM] Moontashi Rajiv 610: It is very difficult for us without door delivery as we get most of our things online 😔
[05/04/25, 4:43:23 PM] ~ nandi sourav5: The same happened with me as well. When was the rule changed to ask delivery guys to keep their vehicle outside?
[05/04/25, 4:44:31 PM] Nagendra Prasad C A 511: Hi all , please let me know if  there are any cricket group in the society
[05/04/25, 9:08:54 PM] Moontashi Rajiv 610: Hi folks - am told it is a safety concern - kindly state how the delivery personnel parking the bikes inside making anyone feel unsafe 😔
[05/04/25, 9:09:45 PM] Moontashi Rajiv 610: It is a matter of great inconvenience to us - kindly consider 🙏
[05/04/25, 9:15:59 PM] Krishna 707: @919886080756 -- we understand your concern. Recently alot complaints and concerns were raised and we were instructed security team. We are also getting delivered from delivery agents but we have no issues. But anyways its all residents call now how all want. ‎<This message was edited>
[05/04/25, 9:16:44 PM] Krishna 707: How a majority wants we will implement
[05/04/25, 9:16:55 PM] Krishna 707: Residents can share their opinion
[05/04/25, 9:17:18 PM] Krishna 707: As of now only CBR vehicles are allowed inside and guests vehicles ‎<This message was edited>
[05/04/25, 9:21:32 PM] Purushotham Reddy Patil: In my observance delivery agents are entering into CBR premises directly without entry and later they are doing the entry which is not the right process.Hence it is asked to stop the delivery vehicles outside the premises and once approval is provided they are allowed to come in with the vehicle. ‎<This message was edited>
[05/04/25, 9:49:15 PM] Apparao Maiskar G7: I think we are trying to over control the layout persons/kids to enter into CBR, even in presence of the owners.

I never saw controlling anyone in our layout for walking or playing cricket or playing in park neither CBR nor outside kids/adults. 

Is it told to security to not allow any relatives or close neighbours along with flat owners inside CBR?
[05/04/25, 10:03:57 PM] Krishna 707: Based on all your feedback we will instruct security. Requesting residents to share feedback on how  you all want to .
[05/04/25, 10:04:32 PM] Krishna 707: Many residents complained on security that they are allowed to lay out people.
[05/04/25, 10:05:07 PM] Krishna 707: Now we need to have a set of instructions to be given to security.
[05/04/25, 10:07:50 PM] Apparao Maiskar G7: Already security are insulting infront of us(owner) to my friend/friendskids, Which I felt is unnecessary over control over families, which will be meaningful if someone is entering without owners prescence. When owner himself is accompanying any kids/family friends we should respect it. ‎<This message was edited>
[05/04/25, 10:09:25 PM] Krishna 707: You are very right. Now solution is required. We understand these concerns. Going forward this should not repeat 
. Expectation vs reality
[05/04/25, 9:35:26 PM] Utkarsh Gupta Cbr: Upon talking to Delivery agent, he expressed that they have a lot of items which can't be left unattended at outside road.. 

I like this approach of getting approval and then parking the vehicle inside the apartment.. 👍🏻
[05/04/25, 10:10:43 PM] Krishna 707: Residents were not aware may be. Security is getting scoldings on how come lay out people are allowed. Can be a miscommunication as well. So we will list out all the things. Hopefully you vl never disappoint again
[05/04/25, 10:12:59 PM] Apparao Maiskar G7: Could one of you please educate me, (I might have missed the message out of 1000s) what action items are pending to consider sft based maintanence calculation over flat based? ‎<This message was edited>
[05/04/25, 10:16:31 PM] Apparao Maiskar G7: Thanks for the consideration and prompt response. I appreciate it.
[05/04/25, 10:38:57 PM] Chandrakant CBR 210: Sft .. based calculations will be Burden for the Higher dimensions flats ..  it’s not Faired to Go on this  approach ..

It’s Better the we should go for  the Divided by  Flats  along with  smaller  dimensions Flats owners should compensate the Higher Dimensions flats ..    Because. Higher Dimensions flat owners  are owning  More Common area shares ..  and Every One Enjoying Equally / more than Equally than the Higher dimensions Flats..

I hope Association will Look on this Approach 
Thank you 🙏..
[05/04/25, 10:44:19 PM] ~ Himansu: Better to go with hybrid approach.. 
List the experience which is common to all - keep in one category (split in all flats) and other item based on used (ex: water .. more you use pay more and vice versa)
[05/04/25, 11:00:11 PM] Deepak Patel 303: We may need vehicle stickers for CBR residents to help security be aware of who is resident and who are guests. Any vehicle without those stickers should be stopped and politely requested for entry approval. 
For the delivery boys, specially Myntra, amazon and others, I think it is fine if all agree to allow them to keep their 2 wheelers parked inside for delivery next to security such that security can monitor their activities as well.
[05/04/25, 11:00:58 PM] Deepak Patel 303: Just a thought on avoiding unnoticed entry.
[05/04/25, 11:03:17 PM] Chandrakant CBR 210: For cycle’s also
[05/04/25, 11:03:55 PM] Deepak Patel 303: In the majority of societies the maintenance is taken as per sq.ft. however a hybrid approach perhaps be an alternate if it makes sense to all.
[05/04/25, 11:16:14 PM] Moontashi Rajiv 610: We have stickers for CBR vehicles - except for cycles.
[06/04/25, 7:58:47 AM] Kishore CBR 304: Hello @917411543306 today morning milk lady delivering milk to our society was denied entry and asked park her 2 wheeler outside the gate. Due to which she had to  carry  the heavy milk container till the lifts.She informed me that it is really difficult for her to carry the container.
I hope that team will instruct the security personnel accordingly

Which includes meter rental and all I believe we have  not collected from the last 3 months for the EV charging that you need to clear.  ( Next week onwards we are getting charging points which will be prepaid based from NBH). 

Thanks
[06/04/25, 11:13:56 AM] Ajeeth 611: Noted.
Happy to clear whatever dues accumulated due to charging my scooty.

You clearly mentioned that you will only pay the MMC and not the variable charges, as you are just a tenant. I had suggested that I will not accept any partial payment. You may please discuss this with your owner and make the full payment accordingly.
[06/04/25, 6:46:24 PM] rajilesh panoli: I gave you those links because you requested them.
[06/04/25, 6:49:44 PM] rajilesh panoli: Just a gentle reminder regarding the pending MMC payment.  50Rupees per day may be applicable for delayed payments beyond the due date from April onwards
Kindly arrange the payment at the earliest to avoid any extra charges.
[06/04/25, 6:54:20 PM] Sai 503: @918547105826 see that what I am saying.
Because of group chat deleted or history so I requested u to share with me again

[06/04/25, 10:41:11 PM] ~ Lakhan: Hi All, One request, please note that if anyone is intentionally paying maintenance delay, that creates a bad impression to those who are paying maintenance regularly on time. So whoever it may be tenant/owner make sure maintenance paid immediately. Else Association please take strict action against those unpaid flats.
[06/04/25, 10:42:21 PM] Krishna 707: Penalty for sure. Any legal we will deal with it

Old regime is not a government darling now
[07/04/25, 8:13:30 PM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: If your taxable income is 24 lakhs n if you can claim more than 8 lakhs deductions in the old regime, probably old regime you can choose.

My wife being a flat owner is facing again issues with the security guy. They are not allowing relative/close friend& kid to play area. What kind of restrictions are we putting on guests that too unknown kids not to enter playing area, I don't know what kind of things we are saving with this approach and strict restrictions over families and even after the owner is accompanied. 

I have plots in zonasha, aez. I never saw this much stifling rules, that too on unknowning kids accompanied with owner.


Just imagine if this kind of restrictions are kept on aez amenities will it meaningful as a daily walker or weekly cricket player. ‎<This message was edited>
[12/04/25, 6:26:48 PM] Apparao Maiskar G7: If it's communicated to the security that visitors even after accompanied with owner are not allowed to enter playing area, then we are somewhere not thinking with humanity. 

I hope and believe guys from cbr are playing , wandering , walking in aez layout too, which is purely maintained by layout owners not by any bda or panchayati.

Please conclude and concretely tell if guests are not allowed to park, straight away to us. I'll plan to put up rules in aez too accordingly. ‎<This message was edited>

The dishwasher consumes less water washes chakchak - n has no mood swings 😁 same with the robo vaccum cleaner that sweeps n mops
[14/04/25, 8:10:36 PM] Moontashi Rajiv 610: From the moment she used to enter till the time she left - she would on call - with wireless earpods - even after requesting so many times - no compliance - as a result bad quality work in excessive amount of time 😨 - n the mood swings due to on going conversations - n sudden no show 😔 

Past few months very taxing on the nerve
[14/04/25, 8:31:29 PM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: True 
Dealing with Machines ( Robos ) is easier than dealing with Maids- Mood swings - lesser concentration - unauthorised Leaves- repeated requests ( demands) for higher amounts make us think twice ‎<This message was edited>

[17/04/25, 10:28:13 AM] rajilesh panoli: Since it is shifting from one place to another removal is not effective, Are we currently facing any difficulties due to honey bees? I don’t think we can continue spending this much money on honey bee related problems, especially since it’s a recurring problem.

We have 2 options

One find a permanent and effective with guaranteed solution.

Second allow the honey bees live piecefuly within our ecosystem as long as they are not causing any issues and as it is staying outside.

Hope we will be able to take a decision based on one of these points.

If the bees settle near entrance area or closer to flats, then we will definitely remove them for safety reasons.
[17/04/25, 10:29:42 AM] Krishna 707: Even I don't like killing them -- my personal opinion. Until unless we disturb them they won't disturb us

[17/04/25, 10:03:40 PM] ~ Albin Jose: I am from Kerala. Usually, we often deal with paper wasp hives at night when they are less active. We use a baton, soak it in petrol or kerosene, and then light it.
[17/04/25, 10:03:53 PM] ~ Albin Jose: Doing it at night makes it safer because the wasps are less aggressive and stay in the hives..

[17/04/25, 10:36:12 PM] rajilesh panoli: We have already done something similar, but the issue is it will be shifted to other locations with in our apartment.  Thanks for the suggestions

PROPERTY TAX ARREARS UPDATE

Dear Residents,

As per information received from our Supervisor Venkatesh, builder has successfully negotiated with the Panchayat officials to adjust the pending property tax arrears.

However, to ensure this adjustment is finalized, all residents with outstanding arrears are requested to clear their dues by *tomorrow, 29th April, 2025*.

Failure to do so will result in the arrears being reflected again, and the respective property owners will be liable for the payment.

We urge all residents to settle their arrears promptly to avoid any future complications.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Best regards,
CBRSRA

[29/04/25, 1:06:50 PM] Deepak Patel 303: Let's wait and try tomorrow. Hopefully it will allow again
[29/04/25, 1:14:54 PM] ~ BKG: Same with me, I was making the payment today morning and the payment process stuck in between

Today afternoon again I tried n successfully paid the amount.
[29/04/25, 3:26:28 PM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: Try after some time, preferably tomorrow.
I think you will be through
[29/04/25, 3:28:19 PM] Deepak Patel 303: What's the best approach to pay..last time I did UPI. Is using the debit card a better approach to get through the payment ? Any advices.
[29/04/25, 3:29:13 PM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: I too paid it from phonepe.
[29/04/25, 3:30:04 PM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: UPI

[29/04/25, 3:30:47 PM] Deepak Patel 303: Thanks..in my case the UPI got stuck but thanks for advice. Let me try in a while.
[29/04/25, 3:31:53 PM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: If it doesn't work after a while, tomorrow it works .

[29/04/25, 7:24:07 PM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: Hi
This property Tax is for Sep ending 2025.
If you pay now, you are getting a rebate of 5% .

I feel that we can pay up to sep 2025 :
Foregoing rebate of 5%

Am I right ?

Can someone help me  with a better understanding  :

Whether interest/ penalty is charged from 30th April 2025 ?
Or
From 1st October onwards ?

If not 
Why are we in a hurry to pay  ?
Of course I too paid today to get that rebate of Rs 330+ 
Hope I am clear ?
[29/04/25, 7:25:41 PM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: Just for a better understanding guys.
No other intention
[29/04/25, 7:35:29 PM] Aritra Ranjan Das 109: As per my investigation, the tax calculation has been different for builder and land owner flats.. 

For land owners flat we are paying 2024-25 arrears which is ~8K, for this seems due date was 31 Mar.. and due to this a bit of penalty is added.
We don’t have anything in current demand.

For Builder share the calculation is completely different .. they are paying Current Demand with no arrears. And they have penalty in negative. i don’t know how this is settled but builder share flats paying much less ~3K.

Also I understand this property tax is for Panchayat and doesn’t follow BBMP timelines to get rebate etc. In panchayat tax is assessed every 2 years.. It was assessed 2022-23, then 2024-25 and it will be again 2026-27.

And these info I derived from internet and after comparing Builder vs Landowner Khata calculations.
[29/04/25, 7:42:02 PM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: Good research Aritra
[29/04/25, 8:08:06 PM] Tamilselvan Sankaralingam Cbr: I paid 23K Something is wrong
[29/04/25, 8:08:37 PM] Aritra Ranjan Das 109: Yesterday?
[29/04/25, 8:10:22 PM] Tamilselvan Sankaralingam Cbr: Yes
[29/04/25, 8:11:34 PM] Aritra Ranjan Das 109: Okay… this is strange .. 😐
[29/04/25, 8:18:45 PM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: Why ?
[29/04/25, 8:20:12 PM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: Probably paid for the year ended 31st March 2025 + advance for 39th sep 2025.
Not sure
[29/04/25, 8:23:28 PM] Utkarsh Gupta Cbr: Should have enquired with Venky, Builder.. 
For me 21k is pending which settlement is still pending..
[29/04/25, 8:28:10 PM] Tamilselvan Sankaralingam Cbr: I guess it's the same for me I should have waited
[29/04/25, 8:28:43 PM] Tamilselvan Sankaralingam Cbr: Its done now can't reverse
[29/04/25, 8:28:57 PM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: Anyway refund/ adjustment for the next year is done by panchayat normally
[29/04/25, 8:30:23 PM] Ramachandhra Andra Bank 611: This is carried forward as an advance and will be deducted from your future tax, if it is made nil For the previous year by the builder - I believe
[29/04/25, 8:31:26 PM] Tamilselvan Sankaralingam Cbr: Thanks sir let's see

[29/04/25, 10:21:04 PM] Vikram Dasari G15: Hi 
The property tax you pay now online with 5% rebate is for an year. 
Property tax is something that needs to be paid at any time. So pay before 30 April, and avail the benifit. Being complaint is better than paying fine / penalty.

[03/05/25, 4:24:55 PM] ~ Shyam Sinha: पूरा देश सदमे में है. 22 अप्रैल को पहलगाम में 26 मासूम नागरिकों को भून डाला क्रूर आतंकियों ने. सभी मारे गए लोगों को श्रद्धांजलि अर्पित की गई. मेरी भी श्रद्धांजलि है पर आप सबकी श्रद्धांजलि से भिन्न है.

26 सक्षम शरीर वाले लोगों को गोलियों से मौत दे दी गई और उनमें से एक ने भी प्रतिरोध नहीं किया. उन्हें प्वाइंट ब्लैंक पर मार दिया गया, जबकि वे उनकी राइफल छीन सकते थे. एक जांबाज जिसने प्रतिरोध किया, वह था खच्चर वाला सैयद आदिल हुसैन. जबकि उसका जीवन तो बिल्कुल भी खतरे में नहीं था (उसके मुस्लिम होने के कारण).

यह 26 सक्षम शरीर वाले एक के बाद एक मार दिए गए मात्र 4 लोगों के द्वारा..! यदि इनमें से किसी एक ने भी प्रतिरोध खड़ा करने का साहस किया होता तो, मै दावे के साथ कह सकता हूं कि यह 26 नहीं मारे जाते. इसीलिए मैं यहां पर सबसे निवेदन करना चाहता हूं कि सभी के पास एक सोच होना चाहिए कि कैसे इस प्रकार से मार दिए जाने से बचें और बचाएं.

याद रखें; यदि आप पॉइंट् ब्लैंक शूट किए जाते हैं तो आप को शरीर के उस अंग पर गोली मारी जाएगी जहां पर एक ही गोली आपका काम तमाम कर देगी. पर यदि आप प्रतिरोध करके उसका कॉपरेटिव टारगेट नहीं बनते हैं तो आप तो अधिक से अधिक संख्या में गोलियां झेलने के बाद भी नहीं मरेंगे. प्रतिरोध करने से कंधे में गोली लगेगी, पैर में लग सकती है, पेट और बाजू भी हिट हो सकते है. कहीं भी. अधिकतम संख्या में. पर नहीं मरेंगे.

युद्ध या युद्ध जैसी परिस्थितियों में बहुत से सैनिकों को गोली लगती है. बहुत सी जब शत्रु पर आक्रमण के लिए आगे बढ़ते हैं. ऐसा बहुत देखा गया है कि 26 और 27 गोलियां लगने के बाद भी बच गए और एक सामान्य जीवन व्यतीत करने लगे. पर यदि वे कॉओपरेट करते तो वाइटल अंगों, सर या हृदय में हिट हो जाते और तुरन्त मारे जाते.

मेरा विनम्र अनुरोध है आप सभी से. एक सोच बनाएं कि कैसे ऐसी विपत्तियों का सामना सफलतापूर्वक करें. बहुत से टेक्नीक हैं. मैं आपका अधिक समय नहीं लूंगा, पर विनती करता हूं कि कृपया कभी भी आतातायी या आतंकी से बिल्कुल भी कोऑपरेट ना करते हुए प्रतिरोध करें और ऐसे सरलतम टारगेट बनते हुए ना मरें.

जब आतंकी आपका पैन्ट खोल रहे थे तब आप क्यों नहीं समझ पाए कि पैंट खोलकर वे क्या देखेंगे. क्यों पेंट खोल दिया. बल्कि ऐसे समय में तो आतंकी इतना पास था कि उसकी राइफल की बैरल को पकड़ कर दूसरी ओर घुमाया जा सकता था. उसके गुप्तांग में एक छोटा सा हिट आतंकी को बेहाल कर सकता था. मैं दावे के साथ आपको कहता हूं कि एक की भी राइफल छीन लेते तो बाकी तीन आतंकी भागते दिखाई देते.

कृपया. कृपा करके एक तैयारी के रूप में इन दिवंगतों को श्रद्धांजलि अर्पित करें. कहीं भी ऐसे स्थान पर जाते हैं तो ऐसी विपदा आ सकती है. तब हिम्मत से सामना करने पर आपकी और आपके साथियों की जीवन रक्षा हो सकेगी. कृपया कभी भी इस प्रकार से किसी अनाचारी के सामने अपने आपको सरलता पूर्वक परोसकर मृत्यु को आमंत्रण ना दें.

I understand we have water scarcity, but at same time it seems the SB Facility team is not monitoring the water level properly. Every time I call them they say we have started the motor, water will come in sometime.. But the damage is already happened till then..

Another guard Mohan has a video evidence of it.. Please take required action.

As per Mohan, he is not able to leave gate to switch ON the motor as the other person is sleeping. Hence no water.
[16/05/25, 10:38:07 PM] Aritra Ranjan Das 109: I request all residents to meet tomorrow and discuss on this negligence.

Today 3 times overhead tank got emptied not due to water scarcity rather human error to monitor water level.

Security is drunk and sleeping at gate since 8 PM

Can we meet tomorrow morning and discuss on next steps on this.

Just for an example: My maid was still working at my flat, but I am getting NoBroker notification that she checked out the society.

I don’t want to drag the conversation now, but lets meet tomorrow morning around 11 Am and discuss in person.

Good to discuss key burnimg issues on water what do we need to do to learn from our incidents of motor , security lapse , water level alarm , efficiency of Chinna , tanker water health concern on TDS and these topics come to my mind . Let's extend our support to the association team but there are burning issues that need resolution ‎<This message was edited>

Meeting without eating 
Right?

So, think whether we can do it at 11.30 or 12 noon ?
A suggestion 
That's all

[17/05/25, 11:35:02 AM] Swagat Shukla CBR: I believe this information is enough to understand the current situation.we have  checked the water level with the help of camera looks fine and the motor guy will come around 1 o'clock for   installation .
[17/05/25, 11:54:59 AM] Aritra Ranjan Das 109: Hi Swagat, Thanks for sharing the information on borewell. But I think we have more problems other than that.. 

Like frequency of monitoring the water level. This problem will still exist even if the borewell is functioning.

Second, the SB Facility team higher authority should come in the society premises and give a explanation on drunk security person.

Hence, requesting you if possible please come down at 12 and spare 15 mins to talk with us.
[17/05/25, 11:55:55 AM] Aritra Ranjan Das 109: Hi Residents, I know very few people said Yes, but again requesting whoever is available now please come down at party hall

[17/05/25, 12:03:21 PM] Swagat Shukla CBR: Hi aritra just a thought we allready spoke to the sb facility 

Regarding this matter but I have question for you as  owner why can't you aks the security leave the premises immediately after you saw him in that condition.is it like only association member responsibility.
[17/05/25, 12:05:55 PM] Swagat Shukla CBR: When we see fire 🔥 🔥 🔥 any where what should be our approach we should wait and watch or we should immediately take action to prevent the situation. ‎<This message was edited>
